        would say that death isn''t funny. It isn''t, unless you''re Shaco - then
        it''s hysterical. He is Valoran''s first fully functioning homicidal comic;
        he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The figure that has come
        to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from whence
        he came, and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief is
        that Shaco is not of Runeterra - that he is a thing summoned from a dark and
        twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation of
        humanity''s dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most plausible
        belief is that Shaco is an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic devices
        until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has proven himself to be a
        cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek him for
        questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such scuttlebutt
        might reassure the native inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable that
        such a malfeasant figure is allowed to remain at large.<br><br>Whatever the
        truth of his history might be, Shaco has joined the League of Legends for
        reasons only he knows. He is a terrifying figure, typically shunned by both
        his fellow champions and the media at large. Only the summoners in the Institute
        of War know why such a creature was allowed into the League, but most Runeterrans
        suspect it to be a means that allows the power that be to keep an eye on the
        ever-elusive Shaco. Unsurprisingly, this champion is popular in places where
        madness can openly reign, such as among the power-hungry summoners of Zaun
        and Noxus.<br><br>Whatever you do, don''t tell him you missed the punch line.","blurb":"Most
